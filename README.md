# MazeGame
This is for project #1 in Object Oriented Design.
We are creating a text-based Maze game where the user can walk through our selection of a premade mazes (level0, level1, and level2) or the user can give a path to their text file that contains their own maze of 0s and 1s, where 0s are considered null rooms and 1s are considered rooms.
