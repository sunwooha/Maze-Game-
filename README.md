# MazeGame
This is for project #1 in Object Oriented Design.
We are creating a text-based Maze game where the user can walk through our selection of premade mazes (level0, level1, and level2) or the user can give the name of the text file that contains their maze consisting of 0s and 1s, where 0s are considered null rooms and 1s are considered rooms.

To run the code, please note that the main class takes in two arguments, the dimension of the maze and the .txt file of the maze! We have provided 3 level mazes and one test maze. 

The level mazes are named: 
+ **level0.txt**
+ **level1.txt**
+ and **level2.txt**  

These level mazes have a dimension of **12** so **please** input 12 as the first argument if you choose to load the level mazes. If you choose the test maze, **tester.txt**, please input **4** as the first argument.  

An example of running this code on the command line would be: **java Main 12 level0.txt**
